## Captcha 1 - The Missing Lake (Web)

### Intro

Our low-budget human captcha solvers have gone missing. We need you to help us crack our way into the city's old database, where did the lake go? We gotta find out!

### Solution

This challenge was a more of a programming challenge where we saved the images and used gocr to get the text from the image.
We used beatifulsoup to extract the base64 image, decode it, write it to a file and used gocr to get the text from it. Doing this 300 times we get the flag. 

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
__author__ = "w0rth"

from bs4 import BeautifulSoup as BSHTML
import os, requests
import subprocess
import base64



def solve_captcha():
    s = requests.session()
    url = "https://captcha1.uctf.ir/"
    for i in range(300):
        r = s.get(url)
        html = r.text
        soup = BSHTML(html, "html.parser")
        print(soup.find_all("h4")[1])
        x = soup.find_all("img")[0]["src"].split(",")[1]
        open('captcha.png', 'wb').write( base64.decodebytes(bytes(x, 'utf-8')) )
        os.system('convert captcha.png -compress none -threshold 16% img.png')
        captcha = subprocess.run(['gocr', '-i', 'img.png'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE).stdout.strip()
        s.post(url, {'captcha': captcha.decode('utf-8')})
    print(s.get(url).text)
    

solve_captcha()
```

flag:  UCTF{7h3_m1551n6_l4k3}


## Captcha 2 - The Missing Lake 2 (Web)

### Intro

Sorry for bothering you again! We forgot to retrieve some valuable assets the last time. They have changed their captcha system, I think they know that we know about OCRs :)

### Domain

Since there was not domain in the challenge I start to looking around the previous domain: https://captcha1.uctf.ir/
However we didn't found nothing. So we tried https://captcha2.uctf.ir/ and we got what seems the challenge 2 of captcha.

### Solution

This time we get animal image. In this captcha we get a combination of two animal images and we need to add both using the following format: `animal1-animal2`
Since animals probably are less than a combination of numbers and letters from the previous challenge, lets make some requests to the page to look what animals can we have. The response contains two jpeg images. We will make 200 requests and store every image in a file. Then we will categorize each image and make a dictionary in python to further solve the captcha. This all in the assumption that we have a low number of animals.


```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
__author__ = "w0rth"

from bs4 import BeautifulSoup as BSHTML
import requests

def store_images(x):
    file = open("images.txt", "w+")
    for i in x:
        file.write(i + "\n")
    file.close()
def get_image():
    
    s = requests.session()
    url = "https://captcha2.uctf.ir/"
    image_list= []
    for i in range(200):
        r = s.get(url)
        html = r.text
        soup = BSHTML(html, "html.parser")
        for image in soup.find_all("img"):
            if image["src"] not in image_list:
                image_list.append(image["src"])
    return image_list

x = get_image()
store_images(x)

```

After making 200 requests we get 11 different images. Bellow is the final list:

```

Response: You have done it! there you go UCTF{Arm3n1an_m0uflon}

## E Corp (Web)

### Intro

Your task is to access the admin panel of E Corp. servers. The admin panel is located at http://admin-panel.local but it's not accessible from the outside.
E Corp. also has a public blog running at https://ecorpblog.uctf.ir
Your task is to access the admin panel.

### Solution

Our goal is to reach  http://admin-panel.local. 
When opening a post we have the following javascript script in the source code:


        const API_PATH = '/api/view.php';

        async function fetchPost(id) {
            const fetchResult = await fetch(API_PATH, {
                method: 'POST',
                cache: 'no-cache',
                headers: {
                    'Content-type': 'application/json'
                },
                body: JSON.stringify({ post: `file:///posts/${id}` })
            });

            const resp = await fetchResult.json();
            if (resp.status == 'success') {
                return resp.post;
            } else {
                throw new Error(resp.msg);
            }
        }

        window.addEventListener('load', async () => {
            const titleEl = document.getElementById('post-title');
            const textEl = document.getElementById('post-text');

            const postId = /[^/]*$/.exec(window.location.pathname)[0];
            if (postId.length == 0) {
                titleEl.innerText = 'Missing post ID';
                return;
            }

            let post;
            try {
                post = await fetchPost(postId);
            } catch (e) {
                titleEl.innerText = e.message;
                return;
            }
            document.title = postId;
            titleEl.innerHTML = `${postId} <span class="blink"> |</span>`;

            textEl.innerText = post;
        });
    
It seems like it gets the user input and send a POST request to /api/view.php with the json body: `{ post: "file:///posts/${id}" }`
By requesting the post it seem like it is fetching the file content of that file.
Lets try to make a payload where the server will fetch the  http://admin-panel.local page, by replicating the POST request made by the server.
The payload:

```
POST /api/view.php HTTP/2
Host: ecorpblog.uctf.ir
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; rv:102.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/102.0

{"status":"success","post":"uctf{4z174_1n_urm14}"}
```

We get the flag: `uctf{4z174_1n_urm14}`

## Htaccess (Web)

### Intro

Your job is to bypass these htaccess restrictions and view the flag files anyway. Good luck!

The page shows the following information:


Helicoptering

The two parts of the flag are available at the locations below:
    part one
    part two

Unfortunately, they are both protected by an .htaccess file:
one/.htaccess

```
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^localhost$
RewriteRule ".*" "-" [F]
```
    

two/.htaccess

```
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} flag
RewriteRule ".*" "-" [F]
``` 

Your job is to bypass these restrictions and view the flag files anyway. Good luck!

### Solution: part 1

The first condition was easy, just change the host header to localhost
```
GET /one/flag.txt HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; rv:102.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/102.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Referer: http://htaccess.uctf.ir/
DNT: 1
Connection: close
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1

Flag: `uctf{Sule_`
```

### Solution: part 2

THE_REQUEST variable represents original request received by Apache from your browser and it doesn't get overwritten after execution of some rewrite rules. 
The THE_REQUEST server variable contains the initial request header of the form: GET /two/flag.txt HTTP/1.1

If there is a condition like: `RewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} flag` it can be bypassed by using percent encoding.
Since THE_REQUEST brings the HTTP header: `GET /two/flag.txt HTTP/1.1`, we can bypass it by encoding the "a" character like: %61.
Using the final payload: `GET /two/fl%61g.txt HTTP/1.1`, we get the flag: `Dukol_waterfall}`


Final flag: `uctf{Sule_Dukol_waterfall}`

## MongoDB NoSQL injection (Web)

### Intro

Welcome to the MongoDB Injection Maze! Your mission is to exploit a vulnerable web application that uses MongoDB as its database backend. Your goal is to penetrate into the system by leveraging MongoDB injection

### MongoSQL Vulnerability
A site is given that seems to be able to do MongoDB Injection. There is no source code. The first step is to break through the login page.

After trying some mongodb payloads with burpsuite we alway get the following response:

```
HTTP/2 302 Found
Date: Thu, 07 Sep 2023 09:25:49 GMT
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 56

X-Request-Id: 9e1568c97968615ce95c8232264ffd06

<p>Found. Redirecting to <a href="/login">/login</a></p>
```

It seems like, when we fail the login it will redirect to the login page.
However when we add the following payload:

```
POST /login HTTP/2
Host: cp.uctf.ir
Cookie: ssid=s%3A5303d8b9-1021-4197-a80c-b16b39f36283.rDQ9mtIhm0QstGCUND6iZWRKMLK1LyGYB37wDwN9j7E; ba07499ab750e5460403c776a406d8aa=2f5d7fb3ebb84203292b3e716d6376d1

```

Note: Change the content-type to application/json!
We are redirect to /home page:


```

```

In this page, seems to have a staff lookup functionality. If we try regex, such as .* we can't find nothing.
The page is making requests to GET /lookup/<input>. 
Using the payload: `'; return true; var x='` we are able to see the list of users. The payload bypasses the conditional expression and store the values in a variable.
The flag is: `UCTF{7_Burukh_Kuchase}`

## Dorn (Steg)
### Intro

I'm hiding somewhere. Find me if you can!!

if you need a password anywhere use this "urumdorn4"

### Solution

We use steghide to extract the files inside the image: `steghide extract -sf dorna.jpg` with the password specified in the introduction.
We get the flag encoded in base64: `uctf{ZG9ybmFfbGFyX3lvdmFzaQ==} `
flag: `uctf{dorna_lar_yovasi}`

## Deb Files The Old Systems

### Intro

Can you believe it? people still use linux? after the emerge of Evil E computers, nobody bothered to use linux systems. anyways, we got this file from database gaurds' pc, can you help us?

### Solution

We get a deb file which is a common extension for debian packages.
To extract it we use: `ar vx uctfdeb-0.0.1.deb`
Inside the data tar(`tar -xvzf data.tar.gz`) we have a executable with the following code: 

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash
if [ -f /tmp/UCTFDEB/dont-delete-me ]; then
        FLAG=`cat /tmp/UCTFDEB/dont-delete-me`
        if ! command -v curl > /dev/null; then
                echo 'Install curl and try again'
                exit 1
        else
                curl 127.0.0.1:7327 --header "flag: $FLAG"
else
        echo '404, there is no flag to be found'
    exit 1
```


Extracting the control tar(`tar -xvzf control.tar.gz`) we get two files:
- control
- postinst

Control file seems to have metadata about the debian package.
And the postinst file is a bash script that runs after installation. 
This file has the flag in it! 
Flag: `UCTF{c4n_p3n6u1n5_5urv1v3_1n_54l7_w473r}`

## Cyber Punk (Forensics)

### Intro

Some cyberpunk hide the flag inside a network traffic. We have dumped the traffic. Your task is to find the flag to save the city.

### Solution

We are presented with a pcap which are captured packets.
Using the filters and searching for the word "flag" we finding a tcp stream with the data: "Here is the flag". Following the tcp stream, we get the flag: `uctf{urm14_n3tw0rk}`

## HTTPS Decryption (Forensics)

### Intro

In this challenge, you are provided with a file containing captured network packets and a file containing master keys. Your task is to decrypt the HTTPS traffic and find the flag hidden within the decrypted data. The target domain for this challenge is mrgray.xyz. Good luck!

### Solution
In this challenge we are presented with a file called master_keys.log and captured_packets.pcapng. To be able to find the flag, we need to decrypt the traffic using the master keys given. To do that we need to head to wireshark preferences and add the keys in the TLS config.

Then we filter for the string uctf which is the initial part of the flag. And we got it: `<h1>uctf{St._Sarkis_Church}</h1>`.

## Deleted Message (Forensics)

### Intro

Cyber Police have seized a computer containing illegal content, but the data stored is secured with a password.

A member of the criminal organization owning the computer was arrested. Police suspect that the password was sent to the criminal via SMS, but the message was deleted right before the arrest.

You’re given a dump of the data partition of the phone (running Android 6.0). Your job as the forensic specialist is to recover the deleted password.

### Solution

Extracting the tar given: `tar -xvzf data.tar.gz ` we get a dump of a android OS. Our goal is to recover the content of deleted SMSs.

Android stores the [messages](https://www.magnetforensics.com/blog/android-messaging-forensics-sms-mms-and-beyond/) in the following database: `/data/data/com.android.providers.telephony/databases/mmssms.db`. 
In some versions we can have it in: `/data/user/0/com.android.providers.telephony/databases/mmssms.db`. 
Lets look for it: `find ./data -name "*mmssms*"`

```
./data/data/com.google.android.gms/databases/icing_mmssms.db
./data/data/com.google.android.gms/databases/icing_mmssms.db-journal
./data/data/com.google.android.gms/databases/ipa_mmssms.db
./data/data/com.google.android.gms/databases/ipa_mmssms.db-journal
./data/data/com.android.providers.telephony/databases/mmssms.db
./data/data/com.android.providers.telephony/databases/mmssms.db-journal
./data/user/0/com.google.android.gms/databases/icing_mmssms.db
./data/user/0/com.google.android.gms/databases/icing_mmssms.db-journal
./data/user/0/com.google.android.gms/databases/ipa_mmssms.db
./data/user/0/com.google.android.gms/databases/ipa_mmssms.db-journal
./data/user/0/com.android.providers.telephony/databases/mmssms.db
./data/user/0/com.android.providers.telephony/databases/mmssms.db-journal
```

Using the [tool](https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/) to open the .db files, we found nothing in the SMS tables. 
Looking at the previous mentioned [article](https://www.magnetforensics.com/blog/android-messaging-forensics-sms-mms-and-beyond/), we keep looking for each database mentioned and can't find nothing.
However the "Android messages" app is not storing the conversations in the path given by the article. It is [in](https://www.reddit.com/r/LineageOS/comments/p8fx6e/where_are_text_messages_stored/): `/data/user/0/com.android.messaging/databases/bugle_db`. As explained in the article this database stores the "Android Messages" which is a message app that some carriers install by default.
Looking at the tables of this database we found a table called parts which contains the flag: `uctf{l057_1n_urm14}`

## Hidden Streams (Forensics)

### Intro

Explore the available streams and consider the different types of data that can be associated with a single filename. Good luck!

### Solution

Once we extract the challenge zip we get a file with the extension vhd. This extension refers to a virtual disk. The next step is to mount the volume and analyse it.

### Mount volume in our machine
We can do this by mounting it in our machine:

```
sudo apt-get install libguestfs-tools
sudo guestfish --ro -a stream-ctf.vhd
run
list-filesystems
mkdir ./stream_ctf
sudo guestmount -a  stream-ctf.vhd -m /dev/sda1 --ro ./stream_ctf
sudo -i
```

Once we have mounted the disk to a directory we change to root user and access it. We found a flag.zip that can't be unziped. 
Using strings command we get `password:Atoosa`. However this do not take us nowhere.


Note: To unmount the disk we run the following commands: `sudo guestunmount ./stream_ctf`


### Autopsy

Using autopsy we get flag.zip and flag.zip:lookbehind.
Flag.zip has the same string we found with the mounting technique `password:Atoosa`.
flag.zip:lookbehind has the string uctf_flag.txt when looking at the file contents with Autopsy. This means that it may contain the flag inside it.

When we export the flag.zip:lookbehind, change the name to flag.zip and extract the content(`unzip flag.zip`), 
we get the following answer: `skipping: uctf_flag.txt           unsupported compression method 99`
Looking at the [error](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/59700) we found out that its root cause comes from an AES error.
The file is encrypted with AES which is a asymmetric encryption. Using the file manager UI, in my case Caja, when we try to open it we are prompt for a password.
Using `Atoosa` we get the flag: `uctf{St. Mary Church}`

## Conclusion

For more information check the following [repo](https://github.com/w0r7h/ctfs/tree/main/2023/urmiactf) where it contains all the files used in all the challenges.
