Hello, w0r7h here! 
 
I'm generally interested in offesive security and threat intelligence. 
Working as a Devops Eng. with focus on cybersecurity workflows, I'm active in multiple platforms 
such as hackthebox, tryhackme and other CTF platforms trying to improve in every way possible. 

This blog is all about improvement by understanding the various challenges we face.  

(Right now, I'm a bit off because I'm finishing my thesis related to privacy in android applications.)
