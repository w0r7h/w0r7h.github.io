Hello, w0r7h here! 
 
I'm generally interested in offesive security and threat intelligence.
I mainly work as a Devops with focus on cybersecurity workflows.  

I'm active in multiple platforms such as hackthebox, tryhackme and other CTF platforms 
trying to improve in every way possible. Right now, I'm a bit off because I'm finishing my thesis
related to privacy in android applications.

The focus of this blog its to share knowledge in the areas that I like and in the same learning from it.
